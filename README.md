# LangChain Zero-to-Mastery

## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering LangChain, a framework designed to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflows. It covers foundational concepts, advanced techniques, and practical projects to help you build robust LLM-powered applications.

## Structure

### 1. Introduction to LangChain [`1-Introduction-to-LangChain.ipynb`]

In this part, we explore the basics of LangChain and how to set up your environment to build applications with LLMs. It includes:

1. **What is LangChain?**
   - Overview of LangChain's capabilities and use cases.
   - Core concepts like Chains, Memory, and Tools.
2. **Setting Up LangChain**
   - Installation of required libraries.
   - Configuring API keys for OpenAI or other LLMs.
3. **Your First Chain**
   - Creating a simple prompt-based chain using `PromptTemplate` and `LLMChain`.
   - Example: A chatbot that answers questions.

This part provides the foundation for understanding LangChain and its modular design.

### 2. Chains and Memories [`2-Chains-Memories.ipynb`]

This part dives into building sequential chains and adding memory for context retention. Key topics include:

1. **Sequential Chains**
   - Creating workflows where the output of one chain feeds into another.
   - Example: Generating ideas and expanding them.
2. **Memory Integration**
   - Adding memory to chains using `ConversationBufferMemory` and other memory modules.
   - Example: A chatbot that remembers the context of previous conversations.

This part demonstrates how to build context-aware applications with LangChain.

### 3. Document Processing with RAG [`3-Document-Processing-with-RAG.ipynb`]

In this part, we implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to process documents and answer user queries. Topics include:

1. **Document Splitting**
   - Splitting long documents into manageable chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Example: Breaking PDFs into smaller sections for processing.
2. **Vector Store Creation**
   - Building a vector store using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings.
   - Saving and reloading the vector store for reuse.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
   - Retrieving relevant document chunks for user queries.
   - Creating a `RetrievalQA` system using a retriever and a combining chain.
   - Example: Answering questions based on uploaded PDFs.

This part is essential for building document-based question-answering systems.

### 4. MORE WILL COME OUT SOON

Stay tuned for future updates covering advanced LangChain topics like:

- Custom Agents and Tool Integration.
- API Automation with LangChain.
- Knowledge Graphs for advanced data representation.
- Multi-Agent Systems for collaborative workflows.
